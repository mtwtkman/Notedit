# Notedit
Dadecated browser for [note.mu](https://note.mu/) implemented by electron.
This is very limited because developed just for editing Text.

# Why
1. I don't need all of services of official(All I need is text edit).
2. This is good chance to try electron.

# Install
I recommend Node v5(I don't use other versions.)
And MacOSX(I don't use other OS)
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/notedit)
```
$ npm install notedit
$ node_modules/.bin/notedit
```

# Note
You know, this is very limited. Specifically...

- Can't browse other's note.
- Not care for number of view.(Notedit fetches all of your articles.)
- Can't configure your account settings.
- Autosave only runs against `focusout` event.

# TODO
so many
